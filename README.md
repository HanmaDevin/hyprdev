# My Hyprland

This is my personal hyrpland configuration. It is heavily inspired by [typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev). 

## Prerequisite

This configuration is aimed towards arch users with a minimal installation.

Just clone this repo _https://github.com/HanmaDevin/hyprland.git_


```git clone https://github.com/HanmaDevin/hyprland.git ~/```


```cd hyperland```


```./scripts/install.sh```

You should be good to go afterwards.
